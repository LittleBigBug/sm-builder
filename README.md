[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/splewis/sm-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/splewis/sm-builder)

This is a simple build/package tool for managing SourceMod plugins and servers.

It uses a simple python-based syntax inspired by Google's [Blaze](http://google-engtools.blogspot.fr/2011/08/build-in-cloud-how-build-system-works.html) tool.

This is a work in progress. Unless you want to contribute, don't try to use it just yet.
